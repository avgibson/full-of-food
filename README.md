# portfolioproject
This is the first web site I have ever created. 
As such, I decided to bring to life a project I've had in my head for a while. 
Here you can see it at its infant stage.

The general concept is to overhaul the idea of recipie blogs/sites/books/etc. 
making them much less wordy, but instead, very visual and very simple.
