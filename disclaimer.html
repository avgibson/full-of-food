   <h2>Everything Explained in Minute Detail</h2>
   <h3>In Alphabetical Order</h3>
   <p><strong><u>c.</u>:</strong> Cup, a unit of measurement (in the archaic imperial system of measurement that I use, not because I don't like metrics, but because I am used to it, having grown up in the USA).</p>
   <p><strong><u>furikake</u>:</strong> Topping that you can shake on. Made with seaweed, sesame seeds, MSG, and some other ingredients. You can buy it at your local Asian market, or just skip it if that seems too hard or not to your taste.</p>
   <p><strong><u>julienned</u>:</strong> Cut into thin strips (think the width of your headphones wire and about 1 to 2 inches long).</p>
   <p><strong><u>kewpie mayo</u>:</strong> If you don't want to look around for some, use whatever mayo you want/have...if you want mayo, that is. If you don't like mayo, by all means, don't include it.</p>
   <p><strong><u>nori</u>:</strong> Sheets of seaweed, like what sushi would be wrapped in. Cut it to whatever shape/size you like.</p>
   <p><strong><u>sushi rice</u>:</strong> Refers to rice that has been prepared especially for making sushi, but also the Japanese short-grained rice that is traditionally used for making "sushi rice"...to go in sushi.</p>
   <p><strong><u>T.</u>: Table</strong>spoon, a unit of measurement (in the archaic imperial system of measurement that I use, not because I don't like metrics, but because I am used to it, having grown up in the USA).</p>
   <p><strong><u>t.</u>: Tea</strong>spoon, a unit of measurement (in the archaic imperial system of measurement that I use, not because I don't like metrics, but because I am used to it, having grown up in the USA).</p>
