   <h2>Everything Explained in Minute Detail</h2>
   <h3>In Alphabetical Order</h3>
   <p>c.: Cup, a unit of measurment (in the archaic Imperial system of measurment that I use, not because I don't like metrics, but because I am used to it, having grown up in the USA).</p>
   <p>ferikake: Topping that you can shake on. Made with seaweed, sesame seeds, MSG, and some other ingredients. You can buy it at your local Asian market, or just skip it if that seems to hard or not to your taste.</p>
   <p>julianned: Cut into thin strips. Think the width of your headphones wire and about 1 to 2 inches long.</p>
   <p>keypie mayo: If you don't want to look around for some, use whatever mayo you want/have...if you want mayo, that is. If you don't like mayo, by all means, don't include it.</p>
   <p>nori: Sheets of seaweed, like what sushi would be wrapped in. Cut it to whatever shape/size you like.</p>
   <p>T.: <strong>Table</strong>spoon, a unit of measurment (in the archaic Imperial system of measurment that I use, not because I don't like metrics, but because I am used to it, having grown up in the USA).</p>
   <p>t.: <strong>Tea</strong>spoon, a unit of measurment (in the archaic Imperial system of measurment that I use, not because I don't like metrics, but because I am used to it, having grown up in the USA).</p>
